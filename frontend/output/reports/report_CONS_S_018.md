### Meter & Feeder Analytics
- **Current Reading:** `0.200 kW` (Voltage: `230.0 V`, Current: `0.00 A`, PF: `0.950`)
- **Diurnal Baseline for Hour:** `3.561 kW`
- **Baseline Deviation:** `-94.4%` (`-5.03 \sigma`)
- **Parent Transformer Unexplained Loss (NTL):** `5.6%`


### Ground Truth Verification (Digital Twin Telemetry Reveal)
- **Active Physical Scenario:** `THEFT_BYPASS`
- **True Physical Consumption:** `3.768 kW`
- **Cyber Reported Reading:** `0.200 kW`
- **Unreported / Stolen Power:** `3.568 kW`
> **Model Accuracy Confirmation:** The detector successfully extracted this anomaly with `82.8%` confidence against physical reality.


### Supporting Evidence Chain
- Drastic consumption drop (94.4% below diurnal baseline, z=-5.03)
- Persistent low-consumption streak lasting 5 consecutive days
- Distribution transformer TX_102 operating within nominal loss limits (5.6%)
- Consumer load is 5.0% of neighborhood feeder peer average

### Technical Assessment
Statistical and electrical analysis confirms a non-technical loss event at meter MTR_S_018. While the consumer has a contracted load of 4.5 kW and an established historical baseline of 3.56 kW, the meter reported only 0.20 kW (a -94.4% reduction). Concurrently, the distribution transformer TX_102 is registering 5.6% unexplained non-technical losses that cannot be accounted for by technical I²R line resistance or core losses. This strong spatial correlation between transformer loss and consumer load reduction indicates an unauthorized meter shunt, line tapping, or bypass.

### Recommended Enforcement / Maintenance Action
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **HIGH PRIORITY: Issue physical inspection warrant. Dispatch anti-theft squad to verify meter shunt/bypass**
